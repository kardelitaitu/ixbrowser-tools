## Features

- **Real-Time Dashboard**: View profile statuses, execution times, and errors.
- **Logs Viewer**: Display recent automation logs with filtering.
- **System Metrics**: Show memory, CPU usage (placeholder for now).
- **Non-Intrusive**: Reads only from `../logs/` without modifying core code.

## Setup

1. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   cd monitoring
   npm install
   ```

2. **Build React App**:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

3. **Start Server**:
   ```bash
   npm start
   or
m metrics: {"timestamp":1761017998225,"totalMemory":95,"usedMemory":28,"cpuUsage":19.4,"storageUsage":75.2,"storageUsed":2801,"storageTotal":3725,"downloadSpeed":0,"lastRestorePoint":"None or error","lastRestorePointTimestamp":"Unknown"}

   Start-Process "node" -ArgumentList "server.js" -Verb RunAs
